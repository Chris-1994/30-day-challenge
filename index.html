<h1>Analyzing Bitcoin mining’s energy and carbon impact: CoinShares</h1>

<p>
  Bitcoin’s energy usage and its indirect environmental impact has always been a
  topic of discussion, from early forum posts with Satoshi Nakamoto to recent
  discussions in the US House of Representatives. In this report, Christopher
  Bendiksen and Matthew Kimmell of CoinShares Research present the results of a
  newly developed data model, estimating both power draw and carbon emissions
  across major countries and regions mining Bitcoin.
</p>

<h2><b> Takeaways:</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Bitcoin mining uses approximately 0.05% of the total energy consumed
    globally.
  </li>
  <li>
    At a current carbon intensity of 466 gCO2/kWh (December 2021), Bitcoin
    produces less carbon per unit of energy than the global average at 492
    gCO2/kWh (2019).
  </li>
  <li>
    The carbon footprint of flared and vented natural gas in the United States
    is more than enough to completely offset all Bitcoin mining emissions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Oil field miners reduce emissions</h2>
<p>
  Oil field Bitcoin miners serve two main benefits: (1) they repurpose otherwise
  wasted natural gas resources to generate useful electricity, and (2) they
  reduce the carbon emissions of flaring and venting natural gas at oil sites.
</p>
<p>
  In the process of drilling and extracting petroleum liquids, associated dry
  (natural) gas is released as a byproduct. Because this gas is dry, i.e. not
  liquid, it cannot be collected in vats and trucked away at low costs. Without
  the specialised infrastructure to process, transport, and store that natural
  gas, it is either burned on site, or vented directly into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  Natural gas is predominantly made of methane. As a greenhouse gas, methane is
  more than 30-times more potent than CO2 over a 100-year period. In that sense,
  each tonne of methane emitted is considered the same as 30 tonnes of
  CO2-equivalent emissions (CO2e).
</p>
<p>
  By removing this gas from flaring towers, oil field miners reduce the CO2e
  emissions of liquid petroleum wells while simultaneously extracting useful
  work from the otherwise wasted gas.
</p>
<p>
  According to CoinShares Research, the potential for miners to reduce the
  carbon footprint of flared and vented natural gas is vast at 78 Mt CO2e in the
  United States alone. This is enough to completely offset all emissions or even
  have a positive net emissions impact.
</p>

<h2>Energy sources are stabilizing</h2>
<p>
  The mining network’s electricity generation mix is more balanced than it has
  ever been, according to CoinShares Research.
</p>
<p>
  Contributions of coal, gas, hydro, nuclear and wind are 35%, 24%, 21%, 11%,
  and 4%, respectively, with the remaining 5% representing small amounts of oil,
  solar, and other renewables (mainly geothermal).
</p>
<p>
  Whereas in the past, the predominant power source of hashrate generation
  fluctuated dramatically with the Chinese wet and dry season, we at CoinShares
  Research now suspect the power sources to be much more stable throughout the
  year. The Chinese ban has reduced and stabilised both the impacts of coal and
  hydropower significantly, with natural gas making up most of their relative
  impact reduction.
</p>

<h2>Stabilizing the grid</h2>
<p>
  Bitcoin mining is an essential puzzle piece in the stabilization of grids
  featuring high proportions of wind and solar generation.
</p>
<p>
  Intermittent renewables such as wind and solar only produce energy when the
  Sun shines and the wind blows. Given this unpredictability, grids with a large
  share of intermittent power generation cannot function properly without supply
  or demand balancing.
</p>
<p>
  If demand and supply fall out of balance, local or wide-area blackouts
  (supply-side) as well as grid congestion or waste (demand-side) can result.
  However, Bitcoin mining can solve these discrepancies as a load balancing
  system, by either quickly reducing consumption when power is in a shortage or
  increasing consumption when power is in a surplus.
</p>
<p>
  The IEA estimates that in order to reach the Net Zero Emissions by 2050
  Scenario, 500GW of Demand Response (balancing) capacity, almost 50 times
  CoinShares estimated Bitcoin power draw, will be needed by 2030. In other
  words, Bitcoin mining can be a significant tool to strengthen and decarbonise
  grids.
</p>
<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>
  The Bitcoin mining network reduces the impact of natural gas flaring, balances
  grid load, and generates electricity at a lower carbon intensity than the
  global average.
</p>
<p>
  At 0.05% of total energy consumption globally, Bitcoin ultimately amounts to a
  rounding error on the global energy balance sheet, a small cost for a global
  network providing freely available, debasement protected, and censorship
  resistant money.
